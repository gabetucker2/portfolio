					I am a second-year Humanities Scholar and Honors student at The Ohio State University pursuing a dual degree in Psychology (B.S.) and Philosophy (B.A.) with a Mathematics minor.  I am completing personalized coursework in computational cognition to focus on my passion: modeling the brain using deep networks and mathematics by examining the cross-section between neuroscience, philosophy, and artificial intelligence.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					I have demonstrated coding experience in a multitude of projects using Python, R, and MySQL, among 9 other languages.  Some of my projects include a procedural terrain generator built using C#, a neuroimaging data visualization application using Python, and an electrical engineering project to contract muscles using EMS electrodes.  My passion project since high school has been creating the first personality type inventory based off the Big Five traits, which is available at oceanpersonalities.com, a website I built from the ground-up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.  Under the guidance of Dr. Wegener, I am currently pending IRB approval to administer my personality survey on students across OSU, and I am going to attend the 2023 Society for Personality & Social Psychology annual convention in Atlanta using funding from OSU’s STEP fellowship to present my research.

					I have begun my Undergraduate Honors Theses in Psychology on mathematical modeling of neuronal spike functions during target identification tasks and in Philosophy on the Lucas-Penrose antimechanism argument in favor of a quantum-based theory of consciousness (Orch-OR).  After completing my undergraduate studies, I hope to earn an M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience.  I then hope to continue my research with the eventual goal of implementing agents based on cognitive architectures like Global Workspace Theory to simulate aggregate human behavior and advance research on artificial general intelligence.

					Outside of academic involvements, I love playing classical piano—particularly pieces by Franz Liszt—and charcoal drawing.  I also competed in the 2019 Fencing Junior Olympic Championships for sabre, and I will soon begin volunteering on a suicide prevention hotline.  If you don’t know me personally but would like to connect, please leave me an email at <a href = "mailto:tucker.854@osu.edu">tucker.854@osu.edu</a>, or connect with me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabetucker2/">LinkedIn</a>; if you leave a note in your connection request, I’d by happy to chat!
